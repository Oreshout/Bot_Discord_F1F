Introduction
------------

Welcome to the official documentation of the **F1F Discord Bot**, a custom-built assistant created to serve the Formula 1 France community on Discord.  
This bot is designed to bring automation, accuracy, and interactivity to your server, improving both user experience and community management.

Why Build This Bot?
------------------

Formula 1 fans thrive on fast, reliable information and a space to share predictions, opinions, and results. Managing such a community manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

The F1F Bot was developed to:

- **Automate repetitive tasks:** such as posting race schedules, results, and reminders.
- **Ensure real-time updates:** by scraping and processing live race data.
- **Engage the community:** through interactive prediction games and commands.
- **Support moderators:** by handling routine administrative tasks, freeing up human effort for more meaningful interactions.

Core Features
-------------

1. **Race Predictions System**

   Members can submit predictions for upcoming Grand Prix events via bot commands. The bot stores these predictions securely and can later retrieve, compare, and display them.

2. **Automated Data Scraping and Updates**

   Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`, the bot extracts live race results and relevant statistics from official websites or trusted sources, ensuring the community stays up-to-date.

3. **Scheduled Announcements**

   The bot schedules reminders, race start notifications, and result postings automatically, maintaining a dynamic and engaging server atmosphere without manual input.

4. **Interactive Commands**

   A rich set of commands allows users to interact seamlessly with the bot, from checking race calendars to viewing leaderboard standings.

5. **Community and Moderation Tools**

   The bot helps moderators by monitoring chats, managing permissions, and automating common administrative duties, enhancing overall server health and safety.

Technical Overview
------------------

- **Language and Libraries:** Written in Python, leveraging `discord.py` for Discord API interaction.
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `requests` for fetching and parsing web data.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Uses Python’s `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent tasks efficiently.
- **Configuration:** Environment variables (stored in `.env` files) manage sensitive data such as bot tokens and server IDs.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design with easily extendable components to add new features or integrate third-party services.
